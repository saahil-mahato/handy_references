## 1. Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the early 1990s. It was designed to be simple, portable, and secure, with a focus on providing a platform-independent environment for developing and running applications.

### History of Java

- Java was originally developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in 1991.
- The first public release of Java was in 1995, with the launch of Java 1.0.
- Java quickly gained popularity due to its platform independence, security features, and ease of use.
- Over the years, Java has evolved with the release of various versions, each introducing new features and improvements.

### Features of Java

1. **Platform Independence**: Java programs can run on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.) without the need for recompilation.
2. **Object-Oriented**: Java is a pure object-oriented language, providing features like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
3. **Simplicity**: Java has a simple and easy-to-learn syntax, making it accessible to programmers of all levels.
4. **Robustness**: Java has a strong type checking mechanism and exception handling features, making it robust and reliable.
5. **Secure**: Java provides a secure execution environment through features like bytecode verification, class loading, and a security manager.
6. **Portable**: Java programs can run on any platform that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
7. **High Performance**: Java provides high performance through features like just-in-time (JIT) compilation and optimizations.
8. **Multithreaded**: Java supports multithreading, allowing for concurrent execution of multiple parts of a program.
9. **Dynamic**: Java is a dynamic language, allowing for dynamic loading of classes and runtime type checking.

### Java Platforms and Editions

Java is available in several editions, each targeting specific needs:

1. **Java Standard Edition (Java SE)**: This is the core Java platform for developing desktop and server-side applications.
2. **Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)**: This edition is designed for developing large-scale, enterprise-level applications, providing features like web services, distributed computing, and enterprise-level security.
3. **Java Micro Edition (Java ME)**: This edition is designed for developing applications for resource-constrained devices like mobile phones, set-top boxes, and embedded systems.

### Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the core of the Java platform. It is responsible for executing Java bytecode and providing a runtime environment for Java programs. The JVM abstracts away the underlying hardware and operating system, allowing Java programs to run on any platform that supports the JVM.

The JVM performs the following key functions:

1. **Loading**: The JVM loads the class files containing the Java bytecode.
2. **Verifying**: The JVM verifies the loaded class files to ensure they are valid and secure.
3. **Executing**: The JVM executes the Java bytecode using an interpreter or a just-in-time (JIT) compiler.
4. **Memory Management**: The JVM manages memory allocation and deallocation using a garbage collector.

The JVM is a crucial component that enables Java's platform independence and security features.

## 2. Java Environment Setup

Setting up the Java development environment is essential for writing and executing Java programs. This section will guide you through the process of installing the Java Development Kit (JDK), configuring your system, and verifying the installation.

### Installing Java Development Kit (JDK)

The JDK is a software development kit that provides the tools necessary for developing Java applications. Here's how to install it:

#### Step 1: Download the JDK

1. **Visit the Official Oracle Website**: Go to the [Oracle JDK download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) (or the appropriate version you wish to install).
2. **Select Your Version**: Choose the version of JDK you want to download (e.g., JDK 17, JDK 21, etc.).
3. **Choose Your Operating System**: Select the installer that matches your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. **Follow Installation Instructions**: Follow the prompts in the installation wizard. You can typically accept the default settings.
3. **Set Installation Path**: Note the installation directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17`) as you may need it later.

### Setting Up PATH Environment Variable

To run Java commands from any command prompt or terminal window, you'll need to add the JDK's `bin` directory to your system's PATH environment variable.

#### For Windows

1. **Open System Properties**:
   - Right-click on "This PC" or "Computer" on your desktop or in File Explorer.
   - Select "Properties."
   - Click on "Advanced system settings."
  
2. **Environment Variables**:
   - In the System Properties window, click on "Environment Variables."
  
3. **Edit PATH Variable**:
   - In the "System variables" section, find and select the `Path` variable, then click "Edit."
   - Click "New" and add the path to your JDK's `bin` directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17\bin`).
   - Click "OK" to close all dialog boxes.

#### For macOS/Linux

1. **Open Terminal**.
2. **Edit Profile Configuration**:
   - For macOS, use:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.bash_profile
     ```
   - For Linux, use:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.bashrc
     ```
  
3. **Add PATH Variable**:
   - Add the following line at the end of the file:
     ```bash
     export PATH=$PATH:/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home/bin
     ```
   - Replace `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home/bin` with your actual JDK installation path.
  
4. **Save and Exit**: Press `CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and hit `Enter` to save changes.
5. **Apply Changes**:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bash_profile  # For macOS
   source ~/.bashrc        # For Linux
   ```

### Verifying Java Installation

Once you have installed the JDK and set up your environment variables, it's important to verify that everything is working correctly.

1. **Open Command Prompt or Terminal**.
2. **Check Java Version**:
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```
   If Java is installed correctly, you should see output indicating the version of Java installed.

3. **Check Compiler Version**:
   ```bash
   javac -version
   ```
   This command checks if the Java compiler is installed properly.

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully set up your Java development environment. You are now ready to start writing and executing Java programs. In the next sections, we will delve into Java basics and explore its features in detail.

## 3. Java Basics

In this section, we will cover the fundamental concepts of the Java programming language, including its structure, identifiers, keywords, data types, variables, and operators. Understanding these basics is crucial for writing effective Java programs.

### Java Program Structure

A simple Java program consists of the following components:

1. **Class Declaration**: Every Java program must have at least one class.
2. **Main Method**: The entry point of any Java application is the `main` method.
3. **Statements**: These are the instructions that the program executes.

Here’s a simple example of a Java program:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### Java Identifiers

Identifiers are names given to elements in a program, such as classes, methods, and variables. Here are some rules for naming identifiers:

- Must begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z), underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
- Can be followed by letters, digits (0-9), underscores, or dollar signs.
- Cannot be a reserved keyword (e.g., `class`, `public`, `void`).
- Identifiers are case-sensitive (e.g., `myVariable` and `MyVariable` are different).

### Java Keywords

Java has a set of reserved words known as keywords that have predefined meanings in the language. Here are some commonly used keywords:

- `class`: Declares a class.
- `public`: An access modifier indicating visibility.
- `static`: Indicates that a method or variable belongs to the class rather than instances of the class.
- `void`: Specifies that a method does not return a value.
- `int`, `double`, `boolean`, etc.: Data types.

A complete list of Java keywords includes:
```plaintext
abstract    continue    for        new        switch
assert      default      goto      package    synchronized
boolean     do          if         private     this
break       double      implements protected   throw
byte        else        import     public      throws
case        enum        instanceof  return      transient
catch       extends     int        short       void
char        final       interface   static      volatile
class       finally     long       strictfp    while
const       float       native     super       
```

### Java Data Types

Java has two categories of data types: **primitive** and **non-primitive**.

#### Primitive Data Types

Java provides eight primitive data types:

| Data Type | Size         | Description                                |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `byte`    | 1 byte       | Integer type (-128 to 127)                 |
| `short`   | 2 bytes      | Integer type (-32,768 to 32,767)           |
| `int`     | 4 bytes      | Integer type (-2^31 to 2^31 - 1)           |
| `long`    | 8 bytes      | Integer type (-2^63 to 2^63 - 1)           |
| `float`   | 4 bytes      | Single-precision floating-point            |
| `double`  | 8 bytes      | Double-precision floating-point            |
| `char`    | 2 bytes      | Single 16-bit Unicode character            |
| `boolean` | 1 bit        | Represents true or false                    |

#### Non-Primitive Data Types

Non-primitive data types include classes, interfaces, arrays, and strings. They are created using defined classes and can hold multiple values.

### Java Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values. In Java, you must declare a variable before you can use it. The syntax for declaring a variable is as follows:

```java
dataType variableName = value;
```

**Example**:
```java
int age = 25;
String name = "Alice";
```

### Java Operators

Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Java supports several types of operators:

#### Arithmetic Operators

These operators perform basic mathematical operations:

| Operator | Description         | Example          |
|----------|---------------------|------------------|
| `+`      | Addition            | `a + b`          |
| `-`      | Subtraction         | `a - b`          |
| `*`      | Multiplication      | `a * b`          |
| `/`      | Division            | `a / b`          |
| `%`      | Modulus (Remainder) | `a % b`          |

#### Relational Operators

These operators compare two values and return a boolean result:

| Operator | Description               | Example          |
|----------|---------------------------|------------------|
| `==`     | Equal to                  | `a == b`        |
| `!=`     | Not equal to              | `a != b`        |
| `<`      | Less than                 | `a < b`         |
| `>`      | Greater than              | `a > b`         |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to     | `a <= b`        |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to   | `a >= b`        |

#### Logical Operators

These operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions:

| Operator | Description                | Example             |
|----------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| `&&`     | Logical AND                | `(a > b) && (c < d)`|
| `||`     | Logical OR                 | `(a > b) || (c < d)`|
| `!`      | Logical NOT                | `!(a > b)`         |

#### Bitwise Operators

These operators perform operations on bits:

| Operator   | Description              |
|------------|--------------------------|
| `&`        | Bitwise AND              |
| `|`        | Bitwise OR               |
| `^`        | Bitwise XOR              |
| `~`        | Bitwise NOT              |

#### Assignment Operators

These operators assign values to variables:

```java
=   // Simple assignment
+=  // Add and assign
-=  // Subtract and assign
*=  // Multiply and assign
/=  // Divide and assign
%=  // Modulus and assign
```

#### Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a shorthand for an if-else statement:

```java
result = (condition) ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;
```

**Example**:
```java
int max = (a > b) ? a : b; // Assigns max with the greater of a and b
```

### Conclusion

In this section, we covered the foundational concepts of Java programming, including program structure, identifiers, keywords, data types, variables, and operators. Mastering these basics is essential as we move forward into more advanced topics in Java programming.

## 4. Input and Output in Java

Input and output (I/O) operations are essential for interacting with users and handling data in Java applications. In this section, we will explore various ways to handle input and output in Java, focusing on the `System` class, the `Scanner` class for input, and formatted output methods.

### Using System.out.println()

The simplest way to display output in Java is by using the `System.out.println()` method. This method prints text to the console and moves the cursor to a new line.

**Example**:
```java
public class OutputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        System.out.println("Welcome to Java Programming.");
    }
}
```

### Using System.out.print()

The `System.out.print()` method is similar to `println()`, but it does not move the cursor to a new line after printing.

**Example**:
```java
public class PrintExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("Hello, ");
        System.out.print("World!");
    }
}
```
**Output**:
```
Hello, World!
```

### Formatted Output using printf()

The `printf()` method allows you to format the output in a more controlled way. It uses format specifiers to define how variables should be displayed.

**Common Format Specifiers**:
- `%d`: Integer
- `%f`: Floating-point number
- `%s`: String
- `%c`: Character

**Example**:
```java
public class FormattedOutput {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 25;
        String name = "Alice";
        double height = 5.7;

        System.out.printf("Name: %s, Age: %d, Height: %.1f\n", name, age, height);
    }
}
```
**Output**:
```
Name: Alice, Age: 25, Height: 5.7
```

### Taking Input using Scanner Class

The `Scanner` class is part of the `java.util` package and provides methods for reading input from various sources, including user input from the console.

#### Step 1: Import the Scanner Class

To use the `Scanner` class, you need to import it at the beginning of your program:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```

#### Step 2: Create a Scanner Object

You can create a `Scanner` object to read input from the console:

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
```

#### Step 3: Read Input

The `Scanner` class provides several methods for reading different types of input:

- **nextInt()**: Reads an integer.
- **nextDouble()**: Reads a double.
- **nextLine()**: Reads a string (entire line).
- **next()**: Reads a single word (token).

**Example**:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class InputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();

        System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
        int age = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.printf("Hello, %s! You are %d years old.\n", name, age);

        // Close the scanner
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### Taking Input using BufferedReader Class

Another way to read input in Java is by using the `BufferedReader` class. This approach is generally faster than using `Scanner`, especially for large inputs.

#### Step 1: Import Required Classes

You need to import classes from the `java.io` package:

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
```

#### Step 2: Create a BufferedReader Object

You can create a `BufferedReader` object that reads from the standard input stream:

```java
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
```

#### Step 3: Read Input

Use the `readLine()` method to read a line of text. You can then convert it to other data types as needed.

**Example**:
```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class BufferedInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

        try {
            System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
            String name = reader.readLine();

            System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
            int age = Integer.parseInt(reader.readLine());

            System.out.printf("Hello, %s! You are %d years old.\n", name, age);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

In this section, we explored various methods for handling input and output in Java. We learned how to use `System.out.println()`, `System.out.print()`, and `printf()` for output formatting. For input, we examined how to utilize both the `Scanner` and `BufferedReader` classes effectively. Mastering these I/O techniques is essential for developing interactive Java applications. In the next section, we will delve into control flow statements that allow us to control the execution of our programs based on certain conditions.

## 5. Control Flow Statements

Control flow statements in Java allow you to dictate the order in which statements are executed based on certain conditions. This section covers the primary control flow statements: conditional statements (if-else and switch) and looping constructs (for, while, and do-while loops). Additionally, we will discuss the break and continue statements.

### If-Else Statement

The `if-else` statement is used to execute a block of code based on a condition. If the condition evaluates to true, the first block of code is executed; otherwise, the second block is executed.

**Syntax**:
```java
if (condition) {
    // Block of code if condition is true
} else {
    // Block of code if condition is false
}
```

**Example**:
```java
public class IfElseExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 10;

        if (number > 0) {
            System.out.println("The number is positive.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The number is negative or zero.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### If-Else If Ladder

You can chain multiple conditions using `else if`.

**Example**:
```java
public class IfElseIfExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 0;

        if (number > 0) {
            System.out.println("The number is positive.");
        } else if (number < 0) {
            System.out.println("The number is negative.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The number is zero.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Switch Statement

The `switch` statement allows you to execute one block of code among many based on the value of a variable. It’s an alternative to using multiple `if-else` statements.

**Syntax**:
```java
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Block of code for value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Block of code for value2
        break;
    // You can have any number of case statements.
    default:
        // Block of code if none of the cases match
}
```

**Example**:
```java
public class SwitchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int day = 3;
        String dayName;

        switch (day) {
            case 1:
                dayName = "Monday";
                break;
            case 2:
                dayName = "Tuesday";
                break;
            case 3:
                dayName = "Wednesday";
                break;
            case 4:
                dayName = "Thursday";
                break;
            case 5:
                dayName = "Friday";
                break;
            case 6:
                dayName = "Saturday";
                break;
            case 7:
                dayName = "Sunday";
                break;
            default:
                dayName = "Invalid day";
                break;
        }

        System.out.println("Day " + day + " is " + dayName + ".");
    }
}
```

### Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met. Java provides several types of loops: `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.

#### For Loop

The `for` loop is used when you know the number of iterations in advance.

**Syntax**:
```java
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

**Example**:
```java
public class ForLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
        }
    }
}
```

#### While Loop

The `while` loop executes as long as the specified condition is true. It checks the condition before executing the loop body.

**Syntax**:
```java
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

**Example**:
```java
public class WhileLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int count = 1;

        while (count <= 5) {
            System.out.println("Count: " + count);
            count++;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Do-While Loop

The `do-while` loop executes the loop body at least once before checking the condition at the end.

**Syntax**:
```java
do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

**Example**:
```java
public class DoWhileLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int count = 1;

        do {
            System.out.println("Count: " + count);
            count++;
        } while (count <= 5);
    }
}
```

### Break and Continue Statements

#### Break Statement

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or switch statement prematurely.

**Example with Loop**:
```java
public class BreakExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            if (i == 5) {
                break; // Exit the loop when i equals 5
            }
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Continue Statement

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and proceeds with the next iteration of the loop.

**Example with Loop**:
```java
public class ContinueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                continue; // Skip even numbers
            }
            System.out.println(i); // Print odd numbers only
        }
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

In this section, we explored control flow statements in Java, including conditional statements (`if`, `else`, and `switch`) and looping constructs (`for`, `while`, and `do-while`). We also discussed how to use `break` and `continue` statements to control loop execution. Understanding these control flow mechanisms is essential for creating dynamic and responsive Java applications. In the next section, we will delve into arrays, which allow us to store multiple values in a single variable.

## 6. Arrays in Java

Arrays are a fundamental data structure in Java that allow you to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. They provide a way to organize and manage data efficiently. In this section, we will cover how to declare, initialize, access, and manipulate arrays in Java, as well as explore multi-dimensional arrays.

### Declaring and Initializing Arrays

To use an array in Java, you must first declare it and then initialize it with values. The syntax for declaring an array is as follows:

```java
dataType[] arrayName; // Preferred way
// or
dataType arrayName[]; // Alternative way
```

#### Example of Declaration

```java
int[] numbers; // Preferred way
String[] names; // Preferred way
```

#### Initializing Arrays

You can initialize an array at the time of declaration or afterward.

**1. At Declaration:**
```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Array with initial values
String[] fruits = {"Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"};
```

**2. After Declaration:**
```java
int[] numbers = new int[5]; // Array of size 5 (default values are 0)
numbers[0] = 1;
numbers[1] = 2;
// ... and so on for other elements
```

### Accessing Array Elements

You can access individual elements of an array using their index. Note that array indices in Java start from 0.

**Example**:
```java
public class ArrayAccessExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

        System.out.println("First element: " + numbers[0]); // Output: 10
        System.out.println("Third element: " + numbers[2]); // Output: 30
    }
}
```

### Array Length

You can find the length of an array using the `length` property.

**Example**:
```java
public class ArrayLengthExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
        System.out.println("Length of the array: " + numbers.length); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

### Looping Through Arrays

You can use loops to iterate through the elements of an array. The `for` loop and enhanced `for-each` loop are commonly used.

#### Using a For Loop

```java
public class ForLoopArrayExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Element at index " + i + ": " + numbers[i]);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Using Enhanced For-Each Loop

```java
public class ForEachArrayExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] fruits = {"Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"};

        for (String fruit : fruits) {
            System.out.println("Fruit: " + fruit);
        }
    }
}
```

### Array Operations

You can perform various operations on arrays such as searching for an element, sorting elements, and copying arrays.

#### Searching for an Element

You can search for an element using a loop or by using methods from utility classes like `Arrays`.

**Example**:
```java
public class SearchArrayExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
        int searchValue = 30;
        boolean found = false;

        for (int number : numbers) {
            if (number == searchValue) {
                found = true;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (found) {
            System.out.println(searchValue + " is found in the array.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(searchValue + " is not found in the array.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Sorting an Array

You can sort an array using the `Arrays.sort()` method from the `java.util` package.

**Example**:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class SortArrayExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {5, 3, 8, 1, 2};
        
        Arrays.sort(numbers); // Sorts the array in ascending order
        
        System.out.println("Sorted array: " + Arrays.toString(numbers));
    }
}
```

### Multi-Dimensional Arrays

Java supports multi-dimensional arrays (arrays of arrays), which are useful for representing matrices or grids.

#### Declaring and Initializing Multi-Dimensional Arrays

You can declare a two-dimensional array as follows:

```java
dataType[][] arrayName; // Preferred way
// or 
dataType arrayName[][]; // Alternative way
```

**Example**:
```java
int[][] matrix = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};
```

#### Accessing Multi-Dimensional Array Elements

You can access elements using two indices (row and column).

**Example**:
```java
public class MultiDimensionalArrayExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] matrix = {
            {1, 2, 3},
            {4, 5, 6},
            {7, 8, 9}
        };

        System.out.println("Element at row 1 column 2: " + matrix[1][2]); // Output: 6
        
        // Loop through a multi-dimensional array
        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
                System.out.print(matrix[i][j] + " ");
            }
            System.out.println(); // New line after each row
        }
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

In this section, we covered the fundamentals of arrays in Java. We learned how to declare and initialize arrays, access their elements, perform operations like searching and sorting, and work with multi-dimensional arrays. Understanding arrays is crucial for effective data management and manipulation in Java programming. In the next section, we will explore object-oriented programming concepts that form the backbone of Java development.

## 7. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to represent data and methods to manipulate that data. Java is a fully object-oriented language, and it incorporates several key principles of OOP, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. This section will explore these concepts in detail.

### Classes and Objects

- **Class**: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.
  
- **Object**: An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with state and behavior defined by its class.

#### Example of a Class and Object

```java
// Class definition
public class Dog {
    // Attributes
    String name;
    String breed;

    // Method
    void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " says Woof!");
    }
}

// Main class to create objects
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of Dog
        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.name = "Buddy";
        myDog.breed = "Golden Retriever";

        // Calling the method
        myDog.bark(); // Output: Buddy says Woof!
    }
}
```

### Constructors

A constructor is a special method that is called when an object is instantiated. It initializes the object's attributes.

- **Default Constructor**: A constructor with no parameters.
- **Parameterized Constructor**: A constructor that takes parameters to initialize attributes.

#### Example of Constructors

```java
public class Car {
    String model;
    int year;

    // Default constructor
    public Car() {
        model = "Unknown";
        year = 0;
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    public Car(String model, int year) {
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }
}

// Main class to create objects
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car1 = new Car(); // Calls default constructor
        Car car2 = new Car("Toyota", 2020); // Calls parameterized constructor

        System.out.println("Car 1: " + car1.model + ", Year: " + car1.year);
        System.out.println("Car 2: " + car2.model + ", Year: " + car2.year);
    }
}
```

### Access Modifiers

Access modifiers control the visibility of classes, methods, and variables. The main access modifiers in Java are:

- **public**: Accessible from any other class.
- **private**: Accessible only within the same class.
- **protected**: Accessible within the same package and subclasses.
- **default** (no modifier): Accessible only within the same package.

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows one class (subclass) to inherit fields and methods from another class (superclass). It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.

#### Example of Inheritance

```java
// Superclass
public class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

// Subclass
public class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() {
        System.out.println("The cat says Meow!");
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate inheritance
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Cat myCat = new Cat();
        myCat.eat(); // Inherited method
        myCat.meow(); // Subclass method
    }
}
```

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon. There are two types of polymorphism in Java:

1. **Compile-time Polymorphism** (Method Overloading): Occurs when multiple methods have the same name but different parameters.
2. **Runtime Polymorphism** (Method Overriding): Occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

#### Example of Method Overloading

```java
public class MathOperations {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate method overloading
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MathOperations math = new MathOperations();
        
        System.out.println("Sum of integers: " + math.add(5, 10)); // Calls int version
        System.out.println("Sum of doubles: " + math.add(5.5, 10.5)); // Calls double version
    }
}
```

#### Example of Method Overriding

```java
// Superclass
public class Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is starting.");
    }
}

// Subclass
public class Bike extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    void start() { // Overriding the start method
        System.out.println("Bike is starting.");
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate method overriding
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle myVehicle = new Bike(); // Upcasting
        myVehicle.start(); // Output: Bike is starting.
    }
}
```

### Abstraction

Abstraction allows you to hide complex implementation details and expose only the necessary parts of an object. This can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

#### Abstract Class

An abstract class cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (without implementation).

```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw(); // Abstract method

    void display() { // Concrete method
        System.out.println("Displaying shape.");
    }
}

// Subclass implementing abstract method
class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle.");
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate abstraction with an abstract class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape shape = new Circle();
        shape.draw(); // Output: Drawing Circle.
        shape.display(); // Output: Displaying shape.
    }
}
```

#### Interface

An interface defines a contract that implementing classes must follow. It can contain abstract methods and constants.

```java
interface Animal {
    void sound(); // Abstract method
    
    default void eat() { // Default method with implementation
        System.out.println("Animal eats food.");
    }
}

// Class implementing interface
class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks.");
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate interfaces
public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Dog dog = new Dog();
       dog.sound(); // Output: Dog barks.
       dog.eat();   // Output: Animal eats food.
   }
}
```

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the practice of wrapping data (attributes) and methods (functions) together in a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some components and can prevent unintended interference and misuse.

To achieve encapsulation:

1. Declare variables as `private`.
2. Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update the value of private variables.

#### Example of Encapsulation

```java
public class Person {
   private String name; // Private variable
   
   // Getter method for name
   public String getName() { 
       return name; 
   }

   // Setter method for name 
   public void setName(String name) { 
       this.name = name; 
   }
}

// Main class to demonstrate encapsulation 
public class Main { 
   public static void main(String[] args) { 
       Person person = new Person();
       person.setName("Alice"); 
       System.out.println("Person's name: " + person.getName()); 
   } 
}
```

### Conclusion

In this section, we explored the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in Java, including classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. Understanding these principles is essential for building robust and maintainable Java applications. In the next section, we will delve into exception handling in Java, which allows us to manage errors gracefully during program execution.

## 8. Exception Handling

Exception handling is a mechanism in Java that allows you to handle and manage unexpected or exceptional situations that may occur during program execution. By handling exceptions, you can prevent your program from crashing and provide a graceful way to handle errors. In this section, we will explore the concepts of errors and exceptions, the `try-catch` block, multiple catch blocks, the `finally` block, and the `throw` and `throws` keywords.

### Errors and Exceptions

In Java, there are two main types of errors:

1. **Errors**: Errors are serious problems that usually occur due to lack of system resources or internal JVM errors. They are represented by subclasses of the `Error` class and are not meant to be handled by the programmer.

2. **Exceptions**: Exceptions are problems that occur during the execution of a program. They are represented by subclasses of the `Exception` class and can be handled by the programmer using exception handling mechanisms.

Some common exceptions in Java include:

- `NullPointerException`: Occurs when trying to access a member (method or field) through a null reference.
- `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`: Occurs when accessing an array element with an index that is out of bounds.
- `FileNotFoundException`: Occurs when a file cannot be found or opened.
- `IOException`: Occurs when an I/O operation fails or is interrupted.

### try-catch Block

The `try-catch` block is used to handle exceptions. The code that might throw an exception is placed inside the `try` block, and the `catch` block specifies the type of exception to handle.

**Syntax**:
```java
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // Code to handle the exception
}
```

**Example**:
```java
public class ExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = 10 / 0; // Throws ArithmeticException
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### Multiple catch Blocks

You can have multiple `catch` blocks to handle different types of exceptions.

**Example**:
```java
public class MultipleExceptionsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
            System.out.println(numbers[3]); // Throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
            int result = 10 / 0; // Throws ArithmeticException
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            System.out.println("Array index out of bounds!");
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Arithmetic exception!");
        }
    }
}
```

### finally Block

The `finally` block is used to ensure that a block of code is always executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. It is typically used to release resources or perform cleanup operations.

**Example**:
```java
public class FinallyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = 10 / 2;
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Arithmetic exception!");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("This is the finally block.");
        }
    }
}
```

### throw and throws Keywords

The `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception, while the `throws` keyword is used to declare that a method might throw an exception.

**Example**:
```java
public class ThrowExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            checkAge(-5);
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public static void checkAge(int age) {
        if (age < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age cannot be negative.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Age is: " + age);
        }
    }
}
```

### Custom Exception Handling

You can create your own custom exceptions by extending the `Exception` class or one of its subclasses.

**Example**:
```java
class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
    public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

public class CustomExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            checkAge(15);
        } catch (InvalidAgeException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public static void checkAge(int age) throws InvalidAgeException {
        if (age < 18) {
            throw new InvalidAgeException("Age must be at least 18.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Age is valid.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

In this section, we covered the fundamentals of exception handling in Java. We learned about errors and exceptions, how to use the `try-catch` block to handle exceptions, handle multiple exceptions, use the `finally` block for cleanup, and create custom exceptions. Exception handling is crucial for writing robust and reliable Java applications that can gracefully handle unexpected situations. In the next section, we will explore the powerful String class and related utility classes in Java.

## 9. Strings in Java

Strings are one of the most commonly used data types in Java. A string is a sequence of characters, and in Java, strings are represented by the `String` class. This section will cover the basics of strings, string methods, and the use of `StringBuffer` and `StringBuilder` classes for mutable strings.

### String Class

The `String` class in Java is immutable, meaning that once a string object is created, its value cannot be changed. Any modification to a string results in the creation of a new string object.

#### Creating Strings

You can create strings in two ways:

1. **Using String Literal**:
   ```java
   String str1 = "Hello, World!";
   ```

2. **Using the `new` Keyword**:
   ```java
   String str2 = new String("Hello, World!");
   ```

### Common String Methods

The `String` class provides a rich set of methods for manipulating strings. Here are some commonly used methods:

| Method                       | Description                                           |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `length()`                   | Returns the length of the string.                     |
| `charAt(int index)`         | Returns the character at the specified index.         |
| `substring(int beginIndex)`  | Returns the substring starting from the specified index. |
| `substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)` | Returns the substring from beginIndex to endIndex (exclusive). |
| `indexOf(String str)`       | Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring. |
| `lastIndexOf(String str)`   | Returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified substring. |
| `toLowerCase()`             | Converts all characters to lowercase.                 |
| `toUpperCase()`             | Converts all characters to uppercase.                 |
| `trim()`                    | Removes leading and trailing whitespace.               |
| `replace(char oldChar, char newChar)` | Replaces all occurrences of oldChar with newChar. |
| `split(String regex)`       | Splits the string into an array based on the specified delimiter. |

#### Example of String Methods

```java
public class StringMethodsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "  Hello, World!  ";

        System.out.println("Original: '" + str + "'");
        System.out.println("Length: " + str.length());
        System.out.println("Character at index 7: " + str.charAt(7));
        System.out.println("Substring (7 to 12): " + str.substring(7, 12));
        System.out.println("Index of 'World': " + str.indexOf("World"));
        System.out.println("To Lower Case: " + str.toLowerCase());
        System.out.println("Trimmed: '" + str.trim() + "'");
    }
}
```

### StringBuffer Class

The `StringBuffer` class is used to create mutable strings, meaning that you can modify its content without creating a new object each time. It is synchronized, making it thread-safe.

#### Common Methods of StringBuffer

- **append(String str)**: Appends the specified string to this character sequence.
- **insert(int offset, String str)**: Inserts the specified string at the specified position.
- **delete(int start, int end)**: Removes characters from start index to end index (exclusive).
- **reverse()**: Reverses the sequence of characters.

#### Example of StringBuffer

```java
public class StringBufferExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello");

        sb.append(", World!"); // Appends to the existing string
        System.out.println(sb); // Output: Hello, World!

        sb.insert(5, " Beautiful"); // Inserts at index 5
        System.out.println(sb); // Output: Hello Beautiful, World!

        sb.delete(5, 15); // Deletes from index 5 to 15
        System.out.println(sb); // Output: Hello, World!

        sb.reverse(); // Reverses the string
        System.out.println(sb); // Output: !dlroW ,olleH
    }
}
```

### StringBuilder Class

The `StringBuilder` class is similar to `StringBuffer`, but it is not synchronized and therefore not thread-safe. It is generally faster than `StringBuffer` and is preferred when synchronization is not required.

#### Example of StringBuilder

```java
public class StringBuilderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");

        sb.append(", World!"); // Appends to the existing string
        System.out.println(sb); // Output: Hello, World!

        sb.insert(5, " Beautiful"); // Inserts at index 5
        System.out.println(sb); // Output: Hello Beautiful, World!

        sb.delete(5, 15); // Deletes from index 5 to 15
        System.out.println(sb); // Output: Hello, World!

        sb.reverse(); // Reverses the string
        System.out.println(sb); // Output: !dlroW ,olleH
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

In this section, we explored strings in Java, including how to create and manipulate them using various methods provided by the `String` class. We also discussed mutable strings using the `StringBuffer` and `StringBuilder` classes and highlighted their key differences and use cases. Understanding how to work with strings effectively is crucial for handling text data in Java applications. In the next section, we will delve into file input/output operations in Java for reading from and writing to files.

## 10. File I/O in Java

File Input/Output (I/O) operations in Java allow you to read from and write to files on the filesystem. Java provides a rich set of classes and methods for handling file operations, primarily through the `java.io` package. In this section, we will cover the basics of file handling, including how to read from and write to files using various classes.

### File Class

The `File` class is used to create, delete, and manipulate files and directories. It does not provide methods for reading or writing file content directly but serves as an abstraction for file handling.

#### Creating a File Object

You can create a `File` object by specifying the file path.

```java
import java.io.File;

public class FileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File file = new File("example.txt");

        // Check if the file exists
        if (file.exists()) {
            System.out.println("File exists.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("File does not exist.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Writing to a File

To write data to a file, you can use classes like `FileWriter`, `BufferedWriter`, or `PrintWriter`.

#### Using FileWriter

The `FileWriter` class is used for writing character files. It can be used in two modes: appending or overwriting.

**Example**:
```java
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class WriteToFileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("output.txt")) {
            writer.write("Hello, World!\n");
            writer.write("Welcome to Java File I/O.");
            System.out.println("Data written to file successfully.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Using BufferedWriter

The `BufferedWriter` class provides buffering for writing text to a character output stream, which improves efficiency.

**Example**:
```java
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedWriteExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("buffered_output.txt"))) {
            writer.write("Hello, Buffered World!");
            writer.newLine(); // Write a new line
            writer.write("This is an example of BufferedWriter.");
            System.out.println("Data written using BufferedWriter successfully.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Reading from a File

To read data from a file, you can use classes like `FileReader`, `BufferedReader`, or `Scanner`.

#### Using FileReader and BufferedReader

The `FileReader` class reads character files, and when combined with `BufferedReader`, it allows you to read text efficiently.

**Example**:
```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ReadFromFileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("output.txt"))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Using Scanner

The `Scanner` class can also be used to read from files. It provides various methods for parsing different types of data.

**Example**:
```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ScannerReadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            File file = new File("output.txt");
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);
            
            while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
                String line = scanner.nextLine();
                System.out.println(line);
            }
            
            scanner.close();
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Copying Files

You can also copy files using the `Files` class introduced in Java 7. This class provides methods for copying, moving, and deleting files.

**Example**:
```java
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.io.IOException;

public class CopyFileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Path sourcePath = Paths.get("output.txt");
        Path destinationPath = Paths.get("copied_output.txt");

        try {
            Files.copy(sourcePath, destinationPath);
            System.out.println("File copied successfully.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Deleting Files

You can delete files using the `delete()` method of the `File` class or the `Files.delete()` method from the `java.nio.file` package.

**Example**:
```java
import java.io.File;

public class DeleteFileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File file = new File("copied_output.txt");

        if (file.delete()) { // Deletes the file
            System.out.println("Deleted the file: " + file.getName());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Failed to delete the file.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

In this section, we explored how to perform file I/O operations in Java. We learned how to create and manipulate files using the `File` class, write data using `FileWriter`, `BufferedWriter`, and read data using `BufferedReader` and `Scanner`. Additionally, we covered copying and deleting files using the modern NIO package. Understanding file handling is essential for managing data storage in Java applications. In the next section, we will delve into packages and interfaces in Java, which are crucial for organizing code and defining contracts between classes.

## 11. Packages and Interfaces

In Java, packages and interfaces are fundamental concepts that help in organizing code and defining contracts between classes. This section will cover how to create and use packages, as well as how to define and implement interfaces.

### Packages

A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. It helps in avoiding naming conflicts and controlling access with access modifiers. Java provides a built-in package structure, but you can also create your own custom packages.

#### Creating a Package

To create a package, you use the `package` keyword at the beginning of your Java source file.

**Example**:
```java
// File: MyClass.java
package com.example.myapp;

public class MyClass {
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Hello from MyClass!");
    }
}
```

#### Compiling a Package

When compiling a class in a package, you need to specify the directory structure that matches the package name. For example, if your package is `com.example.myapp`, the directory structure should be `com/example/myapp`.

```bash
javac com/example/myapp/MyClass.java
```

#### Using a Package

To use a class from a package, you need to import it using the `import` statement.

**Example**:
```java
import com.example.myapp.MyClass;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
        myClass.display(); // Output: Hello from MyClass!
    }
}
```

#### Importing All Classes from a Package

You can import all classes from a package using the wildcard `*`.

```java
import com.example.myapp.*; // Imports all classes from the myapp package
```

### Access Modifiers in Packages

Access modifiers control the visibility of classes, methods, and variables. In the context of packages:

- **Public**: The class is accessible from any other class.
- **Protected**: The class is accessible within its own package and by subclasses.
- **Default (no modifier)**: The class is accessible only within its own package.
- **Private**: The class is accessible only within its own class.

### Interfaces

An interface in Java is a reference type that defines a contract for classes to implement. It can contain abstract methods (methods without bodies) and constants (public static final variables). Interfaces provide a way to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.

#### Defining an Interface

You can define an interface using the `interface` keyword.

**Example**:
```java
public interface Animal {
    void sound(); // Abstract method
    void eat();   // Abstract method
}
```

#### Implementing an Interface

A class implements an interface using the `implements` keyword. A class must provide concrete implementations for all abstract methods defined in the interface.

**Example**:
```java
public class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks.");
    }

    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Dog eats meat.");
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate interface implementation
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.sound(); // Output: Dog barks.
        myDog.eat();   // Output: Dog eats meat.
    }
}
```

### Default Methods in Interfaces (Java 8 and later)

Java 8 introduced default methods, allowing you to provide a default implementation for methods in an interface. This helps in extending interfaces without breaking existing implementations.

**Example**:
```java
public interface Animal {
    void sound();
    
    default void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Animal sleeps.");
    }
}

public class Cat implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows.");
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate default methods
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Cat myCat = new Cat();
        myCat.sound(); // Output: Cat meows.
        myCat.sleep(); // Output: Animal sleeps.
    }
}
```

### Static Methods in Interfaces (Java 8 and later)

Interfaces can also have static methods, which can be called without creating an instance of the interface.

**Example**:
```java
public interface MathOperations {
    static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate static methods in interfaces
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = MathOperations.add(5, 10); // Calling static method directly from interface
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum); // Output: Sum: 15
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

In this section, we explored packages and interfaces in Java. We learned how to create and use packages for organizing related classes and how to define and implement interfaces for establishing contracts between classes. Understanding these concepts is essential for building modular and maintainable Java applications. In the next section, we will delve into multithreading in Java, which allows concurrent execution of tasks.

## 12. Multithreading

Multithreading is a powerful feature in Java that allows concurrent execution of two or more threads. A thread is a lightweight process that can run independently, enabling efficient use of CPU resources and improving the performance of applications. This section will cover the basics of multithreading, how to create threads, thread lifecycle, synchronization, and inter-thread communication.

### What is a Thread?

A thread is a sequence of executed instructions within a program. Each thread has its own stack, program counter, and local variables but shares the heap memory with other threads in the same process. Java provides built-in support for multithreading through the `java.lang.Thread` class and the `java.lang.Runnable` interface.

### Creating Threads

There are two primary ways to create a thread in Java:

1. **By Extending the Thread Class**
2. **By Implementing the Runnable Interface**

#### 1. Extending the Thread Class

You can create a new thread by creating a subclass of the `Thread` class and overriding its `run()` method.

**Example**:
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Thread: " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Sleep for 500 milliseconds
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate thread creation
public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread myThread = new MyThread();
        myThread.start(); // Start the thread
    }
}
```

#### 2. Implementing the Runnable Interface

You can also create a thread by implementing the `Runnable` interface and passing an instance of it to a `Thread` object.

**Example**:
```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Runnable: " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Sleep for 500 milliseconds
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate Runnable implementation
public class RunnableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
        Thread thread = new Thread(myRunnable);
        thread.start(); // Start the thread
    }
}
```

### Thread Lifecycle

A thread goes through various states during its lifecycle:

1. **New**: The thread is created but not yet started.
2. **Runnable**: The thread is ready to run and waiting for CPU time.
3. **Blocked**: The thread is blocked waiting for a monitor lock.
4. **Waiting**: The thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action.
5. **Timed Waiting**: The thread is waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a specified waiting time.
6. **Terminated**: The thread has completed its execution.

### Thread Synchronization

In multithreaded applications, multiple threads may attempt to access shared resources simultaneously, leading to data inconsistency or corruption. To prevent this, synchronization is used.

#### Synchronized Methods

You can declare a method as synchronized using the `synchronized` keyword, ensuring that only one thread can execute it at any given time.

**Example**:
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() { // Synchronized method
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate synchronization
public class SynchronizationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        // Create multiple threads that increment the counter
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) counter.increment();
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) counter.increment();
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join(); // Wait for t1 to finish
        t2.join(); // Wait for t2 to finish

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount()); // Output should be 2000
    }
}
```

#### Synchronized Blocks

You can also synchronize specific blocks of code instead of entire methods, providing finer control over synchronization.

**Example**:
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        synchronized (this) { // Synchronized block
            count++;
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Inter-Thread Communication

Java provides methods like `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` for inter-thread communication. These methods are defined in the `Object` class and are used to facilitate communication between threads that share resources.

#### Example of Inter-Thread Communication

```java
class SharedResource {
    private int number;
    private boolean ready = false;

    public synchronized int getNumber() throws InterruptedException {
        while (!ready) { // Wait until number is ready
            wait();
        }
        ready = false;
        notify(); // Notify producer that number has been consumed
        return number;
    }

    public synchronized void setNumber(int number) throws InterruptedException {
        while (ready) { // Wait until number is consumed
            wait();
        }
        this.number = number;
        ready = true;
        notify(); // Notify consumer that number is ready
    }
}

// Producer and Consumer classes demonstrating inter-thread communication
class Producer implements Runnable {
    private SharedResource resource;

    public Producer(SharedResource resource) {
        this.resource = resource;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                resource.setNumber(i);
                System.out.println("Produced: " + i);
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate time taken to produce an item
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

class Consumer implements Runnable {
    private SharedResource resource;

    public Consumer(SharedResource resource) {
        this.resource = resource;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                int value = resource.getNumber();
                System.out.println("Consumed: " + value);
                Thread.sleep(1500); // Simulate time taken to consume an item
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate producer-consumer problem using threads
public class InterThreadCommunicationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();
        
        Thread producerThread = new Thread(new Producer(resource));
        Thread consumerThread = new Thread(new Consumer(resource));
        
        producerThread.start();
        consumerThread.start();
        
        try {
            producerThread.join();
            consumerThread.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        
        System.out.println("Production and consumption completed.");
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

In this section, we explored multithreading in Java, including how to create threads by extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface. We discussed the lifecycle of threads, synchronization techniques to prevent data inconsistency, and inter-thread communication mechanisms using `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`. Mastering multithreading is essential for developing high-performance Java applications that can efficiently utilize system resources. In the next section, we will delve into Java's Collections Framework, which provides powerful data structures for storing and manipulating groups of objects.

## 13. Collections Framework

The Java Collections Framework (JCF) is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections of objects. It provides a set of interfaces, implementations, and algorithms to manage groups of objects efficiently. This section will cover the core interfaces of the Collections Framework, commonly used classes, and their key features.

### Core Interfaces of the Collections Framework

The Java Collections Framework includes several core interfaces that define the behavior of various collection types:

1. **Collection**: The root interface in the collection hierarchy. It defines basic operations for collections.

2. **List**: An ordered collection (also known as a sequence) that allows duplicate elements. Elements can be accessed by their integer index.

3. **Set**: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements. It models the mathematical set abstraction.

4. **Map**: An object that maps keys to values, where each key is unique. It does not allow duplicate keys.

5. **Queue**: A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing. It follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

6. **Deque**: A double-ended queue that allows elements to be added or removed from both ends.

### Commonly Used Classes

Here are some commonly used classes that implement these interfaces:

#### 1. List Implementations

- **ArrayList**: A resizable array implementation of the List interface. It provides fast random access and is suitable for storing lists of items.

  ```java
  import java.util.ArrayList;
  
  public class ArrayListExample {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          ArrayList<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>();
          fruits.add("Apple");
          fruits.add("Banana");
          fruits.add("Cherry");
          
          System.out.println("Fruits: " + fruits);
          System.out.println("First fruit: " + fruits.get(0)); // Access by index
      }
  }
  ```

- **LinkedList**: A doubly linked list implementation of the List interface. It is more efficient than ArrayList for insertions and deletions but slower for random access.

  ```java
  import java.util.LinkedList;
  
  public class LinkedListExample {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          LinkedList<String> animals = new LinkedList<>();
          animals.add("Dog");
          animals.add("Cat");
          animals.addFirst("Rabbit"); // Add at the beginning
          
          System.out.println("Animals: " + animals);
      }
  }
  ```

#### 2. Set Implementations

- **HashSet**: An implementation of the Set interface that uses a hash table for storage. It does not guarantee any order and allows null elements.

  ```java
  import java.util.HashSet;
  
  public class HashSetExample {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          HashSet<String> colors = new HashSet<>();
          colors.add("Red");
          colors.add("Green");
          colors.add("Blue");
          colors.add("Red"); // Duplicate will not be added
          
          System.out.println("Colors: " + colors);
      }
  }
  ```

- **TreeSet**: A NavigableSet implementation based on a red-black tree, which orders its elements in natural order or by a specified comparator.

  ```java
  import java.util.TreeSet;
  
  public class TreeSetExample {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          TreeSet<Integer> numbers = new TreeSet<>();
          numbers.add(5);
          numbers.add(1);
          numbers.add(3);
          
          System.out.println("Sorted Numbers: " + numbers); // Output will be sorted
      }
  }
  ```

#### 3. Map Implementations

- **HashMap**: An implementation of the Map interface that uses a hash table for storage. It allows null values and one null key and does not guarantee any order.

  ```java
  import java.util.HashMap;
  
  public class HashMapExample {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          HashMap<String, Integer> scores = new HashMap<>();
          scores.put("Alice", 90);
          scores.put("Bob", 85);
          
          System.out.println("Alice's Score: " + scores.get("Alice"));
      }
  }
  ```

- **TreeMap**: A NavigableMap implementation based on a red-black tree, which orders its keys in natural order or by a specified comparator.

  ```java
  import java.util.TreeMap;
  
  public class TreeMapExample {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          TreeMap<String, Integer> grades = new TreeMap<>();
          grades.put("Math", 95);
          grades.put("Science", 90);
          
          System.out.println("Grades: " + grades); // Output will be sorted by keys
      }
  }
  ```

#### 4. Queue Implementations

- **PriorityQueue**: An implementation of the Queue interface that orders its elements based on their natural ordering or by a comparator provided at queue construction time.

  ```java
  import java.util.PriorityQueue;

  public class PriorityQueueExample {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
          pq.add(10);
          pq.add(20);
          pq.add(15);

          System.out.println("Priority Queue: " + pq.poll()); // Retrieves and removes head of queue (smallest element)
      }
  }
  ```

### Iterating Over Collections

You can iterate over collections using various methods:

1. **For-each Loop**:
   ```java
   for (String fruit : fruits) {
       System.out.println(fruit);
   }
   ```

2. **Iterator**:
   ```java
   Iterator<String> iterator = fruits.iterator();
   while (iterator.hasNext()) {
       System.out.println(iterator.next());
   }
   ```

3. **Stream API (Java 8 and later)**:
   ```java
   fruits.stream().forEach(System.out::println);
   ```

### Common Operations on Collections

The Collections Framework provides several utility methods in the `Collections` class for performing operations like sorting, searching, and shuffling:

- **Sorting**:
   ```java
   Collections.sort(fruits); // Sorts a List in natural order
   ```

- **Searching**:
   ```java
   int index = Collections.binarySearch(fruits, "Banana"); // Searches for an element in a sorted List
   ```

- **Shuffling**:
   ```java
   Collections.shuffle(fruits); // Randomly shuffles the elements in a List
   ```

### Conclusion

In this section, we explored the Java Collections Framework, including its core interfaces and commonly used classes such as `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`, and `PriorityQueue`. We discussed how to iterate over collections and perform common operations using utility methods from the `Collections` class. Understanding the Collections Framework is essential for efficient data management and manipulation in Java applications. In the next section, we will delve into generics in Java, which enhance type safety and code reusability when working with collections and other data structures.

## 14. Generics

Generics is a feature in Java that allows you to write code that works with different data types without needing to know the specific type at compile-time. It provides type safety and eliminates the need for explicit type casting. Generics were introduced in Java 5 and have since become an integral part of the Java Collections Framework and many other Java APIs.

### Generic Methods

A generic method is a method that can be called with arguments of different types, depending on the type parameters defined for the method. The type parameters are specified within angle brackets `<>`.

**Example of a Generic Method**:
```java
public static <T> void printArray(T[] array) {
    for (T element : array) {
        System.out.println(element);
    }
}
```

You can call this method with different types of arrays:
```java
String[] stringArray = {"Hello", "World"};
Integer[] intArray = {1, 2, 3};

printArray(stringArray);
printArray(intArray);
```

### Generic Classes

A generic class is a class that can be parameterized with different types. The type parameters are specified within angle brackets `<>` in the class declaration.

**Example of a Generic Class**:
```java
public class Box<T> {
    private T item;

    public void set(T item) {
        this.item = item;
    }

    public T get() {
        return item;
    }
}
```

You can create instances of the `Box` class with different types:
```java
Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();
stringBox.set("Hello");
String message = stringBox.get();

Box<Integer> integerBox = new Box<>();
integerBox.set(42);
int number = integerBox.get();
```

### Bounded Type Parameters

Sometimes, you may want to restrict the types that can be used as type arguments for a generic type parameter. This is known as bounded type parameters.

**Example of a Bounded Type Parameter**:
```java
public static <T extends Number> double sum(T[] array) {
    double sum = 0;
    for (T element : array) {
        sum += element.doubleValue();
    }
    return sum;
}
```

In this example, the type parameter `T` is bounded by the `Number` class, which means that only types that are `Number` or a subclass of `Number` can be used as type arguments.

You can call the `sum` method with arrays of `Number` types:
```java
Integer[] intArray = {1, 2, 3};
Double[] doubleArray = {1.5, 2.5, 3.5};

double intSum = sum(intArray);
double doubleSum = sum(doubleArray);
```

### Wildcard Type Arguments

Wildcards are used to represent unknown types in generic code. They are denoted by the `?` symbol.

**Example of a Wildcard Type Argument**:
```java
public static void printList(List<?> list) {
    for (Object element : list) {
        System.out.println(element);
    }
}
```

The `printList` method can accept lists of any type, and the elements will be printed using the `Object` class.

You can call the `printList` method with lists of different types:
```java
List<String> stringList = Arrays.asList("Hello", "World");
List<Integer> integerList = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);

printList(stringList);
printList(integerList);
```

### Benefits of Generics

Using generics in Java provides several benefits:

1. **Type Safety**: Generics help catch type-related errors at compile-time rather than runtime, making your code more robust and less prone to errors.

2. **Code Reuse**: Generic code can be reused with different types, reducing code duplication and improving code maintainability.

3. **Elimination of Casts**: Generics eliminate the need for explicit type casting in many situations, making your code cleaner and more readable.

4. **Documentation**: Generics provide a way to document the intended use of a class or method, making it easier for other developers to understand and use your code.

### Conclusion

In this section, we explored generics in Java, including how to define generic methods and classes, use bounded type parameters, and work with wildcard type arguments. Generics are a powerful feature that enhances type safety and code reusability in Java. Understanding generics is crucial when working with collections and other data structures that require type parameterization. In the next section, we will delve into annotations in Java, which provide metadata about the code itself.

## 15. Annotations

Annotations in Java are a form of metadata that provide data about a program but are not part of the program itself. They can be used to provide information to the compiler, runtime, or development tools. Annotations are widely used in Java for various purposes, including configuration, code analysis, and documentation.

### Types of Annotations

Java supports several types of annotations:

1. **Marker Annotations**: These annotations do not contain any elements. They are used to mark a class or method for a specific purpose.
   ```java
   @Deprecated
   public void oldMethod() {
       // This method is deprecated
   }
   ```

2. **Single-Value Annotations**: These annotations contain a single element.
   ```java
   @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
   public void myMethod() {
       // Suppress unchecked warnings
   }
   ```

3. **Multi-Value Annotations**: These annotations can contain multiple elements.
   ```java
   @CustomAnnotation(name = "Example", value = 42)
   public void myAnnotatedMethod() {
       // Method implementation
   }
   ```

### Built-in Annotations

Java provides several built-in annotations that serve specific purposes:

1. **@Override**: Indicates that a method is overriding a method from its superclass.
   ```java
   @Override
   public String toString() {
       return "Custom String Representation";
   }
   ```

2. **@Deprecated**: Marks a method or class as deprecated, indicating that it should no longer be used.
   ```java
   @Deprecated
   public void oldMethod() {
       // This method is deprecated
   }
   ```

3. **@SuppressWarnings**: Instructs the compiler to suppress specific warnings.
   ```java
   @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
   public void myMethod() {
       // Suppress unchecked warnings
   }
   ```

4. **@FunctionalInterface**: Indicates that an interface is intended to be a functional interface (i.e., it has exactly one abstract method).
   ```java
   @FunctionalInterface
   public interface MyFunctionalInterface {
       void execute();
   }
   ```

### Creating Custom Annotations

You can create your own custom annotations by defining an interface and using the `@interface` keyword.

#### Example of a Custom Annotation

```java
import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;

// Define the custom annotation
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) // The annotation will be available at runtime
@Target(ElementType.METHOD) // The annotation can be applied to methods
public @interface CustomAnnotation {
    String name();
    int value();
}
```

### Using Custom Annotations

You can use your custom annotation on classes, methods, or fields.

```java
public class MyClass {

    @CustomAnnotation(name = "Example", value = 42)
    public void myAnnotatedMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is an annotated method.");
    }
}
```

### Accessing Annotations at Runtime

You can access annotations at runtime using reflection. This allows you to inspect classes, methods, and fields for annotations.

#### Example of Accessing Annotations

```java
import java.lang.reflect.Method;

public class AnnotationProcessor {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Method method = MyClass.class.getMethod("myAnnotatedMethod");

        if (method.isAnnotationPresent(CustomAnnotation.class)) {
            CustomAnnotation annotation = method.getAnnotation(CustomAnnotation.class);
            System.out.println("Name: " + annotation.name());
            System.out.println("Value: " + annotation.value());
        }
    }
}
```

### Retention Policies

Annotations have retention policies that determine how long they are retained:

1. **SOURCE**: The annotation is retained only in the source code and discarded by the compiler.
2. **CLASS**: The annotation is retained in the class file but not available at runtime (default).
3. **RUNTIME**: The annotation is retained at runtime and can be accessed via reflection.

### Conclusion

In this section, we explored annotations in Java, including their types, built-in annotations, and how to create and use custom annotations. We also discussed how to access annotations at runtime using reflection and the different retention policies that determine how long annotations are available. Annotations are a powerful feature in Java that enhances code readability, provides metadata for frameworks (like Spring), and facilitates various programming tasks. In the next section, we will delve into functional programming concepts introduced in Java 8, including lambda expressions and the Stream API.

## 16. Functional Programming in Java

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. Java introduced functional programming features in Java 8, allowing developers to write cleaner and more concise code. This section will cover lambda expressions, method references, and the Stream API.

### Lambda Expressions

Lambda expressions are a key feature of functional programming in Java. They provide a clear and concise way to represent instances of single-method interfaces (functional interfaces) using an expression. A lambda expression can be thought of as an anonymous method.

#### Syntax of Lambda Expressions

The syntax for a lambda expression is as follows:

```
(parameters) -> expression
```

If there are multiple parameters, they should be enclosed in parentheses:

```
(parameter1, parameter2) -> expression
```

For a block body with multiple statements, use curly braces:

```
(parameters) -> { statements }
```

#### Example of Lambda Expressions

Here’s a simple example demonstrating the use of a lambda expression to print elements from a list:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class LambdaExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
        numbers.add(5);
        numbers.add(9);
        numbers.add(8);
        numbers.add(1);

        // Using lambda expression to print each number
        numbers.forEach(n -> System.out.println(n));
    }
}
```

### Functional Interfaces

A functional interface is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method. Lambda expressions can be used to provide implementations for these interfaces. Java provides several built-in functional interfaces in the `java.util.function` package, such as `Consumer`, `Supplier`, `Function`, and `Predicate`.

#### Example of a Functional Interface

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunction {
    int apply(int x);
}

public class FunctionalInterfaceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyFunction square = (x) -> x * x; // Lambda expression implementing MyFunction
        System.out.println("Square of 5: " + square.apply(5)); // Output: Square of 5: 25
    }
}
```

### Method References

Method references provide a way to refer to methods without invoking them directly. They are a shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method. Method references can be used when you want to refer to an existing method by its name.

#### Types of Method References

1. **Reference to a Static Method**:
   ```java
   Function<String, Integer> stringToLength = String::length;
   ```

2. **Reference to an Instance Method**:
   ```java
   MyClass myClassInstance = new MyClass();
   Consumer<String> printer = myClassInstance::print;
   ```

3. **Reference to a Constructor**:
   ```java
   Supplier<MyClass> myClassSupplier = MyClass::new;
   ```

### Stream API

The Stream API is another significant feature introduced in Java 8 that allows for functional-style operations on sequences of elements (such as collections). Streams provide methods for filtering, mapping, and reducing data in a declarative way.

#### Creating Streams

You can create streams from collections:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class StreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
        
        // Creating a stream from the list and printing each name
        names.stream().forEach(name -> System.out.println(name));
    }
}
```

#### Stream Operations

Streams support various operations, including:

1. **Filtering**:
   ```java
   names.stream()
        .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A"))
        .forEach(System.out::println); // Output: Alice
   ```

2. **Mapping**:
   ```java
   List<Integer> nameLengths = names.stream()
                                     .map(String::length)
                                     .collect(Collectors.toList());
   System.out.println(nameLengths); // Output: [5, 3, 7]
   ```

3. **Reducing**:
   ```java
   int totalLength = names.stream()
                          .mapToInt(String::length)
                          .sum();
   System.out.println("Total length: " + totalLength); // Output: Total length: 15
   ```

4. **Collecting**:
   You can collect results into different data structures.
   ```java
   List<String> filteredNames = names.stream()
                                      .filter(name -> name.length() > 3)
                                      .collect(Collectors.toList());
   ```

### Conclusion

In this section, we explored functional programming concepts introduced in Java 8, focusing on lambda expressions, functional interfaces, method references, and the Stream API. These features enable developers to write more concise and readable code while leveraging the power of functional programming paradigms in Java. Understanding these concepts is crucial for developing modern Java applications that efficiently process data collections and implement complex logic with ease. In the next section, we will delve into Java 8 features that further enhance the language's capabilities.

## 17. Java 8 Features

Java 8 introduced several significant features that enhanced the language's capabilities, making it more powerful and easier to use. This section will cover some of the most notable features introduced in Java 8, including default methods in interfaces, the `Optional` class, the new Date and Time API, and the Stream API (which we discussed previously).

### 1. Default and Static Methods in Interfaces

Java 8 allows interfaces to have default methods and static methods. This feature enables developers to add new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.

#### Default Methods

A default method is defined with the `default` keyword in an interface. It provides a default implementation that can be overridden by implementing classes.

**Example**:
```java
interface MyInterface {
    void regularMethod(); // Abstract method

    default void defaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a default method.");
    }
}

class MyClass implements MyInterface {
    @Override
    public void regularMethod() {
        System.out.println("Implementing regular method.");
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate default methods
public class DefaultMethodExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
        myClass.regularMethod(); // Output: Implementing regular method.
        myClass.defaultMethod(); // Output: This is a default method.
    }
}
```

#### Static Methods

Static methods can also be defined in interfaces. These methods are called on the interface itself rather than on instances of implementing classes.

**Example**:
```java
interface Utility {
    static void printMessage() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method in an interface.");
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate static methods
public class StaticMethodExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Utility.printMessage(); // Output: This is a static method in an interface.
    }
}
```

### 2. Optional Class

The `Optional` class is a container object which may or may not contain a non-null value. It is used to avoid `NullPointerExceptions` and represents a better way to handle optional values.

#### Creating Optional Objects

You can create an `Optional` object using the following methods:

- **of()**: Creates an Optional with a non-null value.
- **ofNullable()**: Creates an Optional that may or may not contain a value (can be null).
- **empty()**: Creates an empty Optional.

**Example**:
```java
import java.util.Optional;

public class OptionalExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Optional<String> optionalValue = Optional.of("Hello");
        Optional<String> emptyValue = Optional.empty();
        Optional<String> nullableValue = Optional.ofNullable(null);

        // Checking if value is present
        System.out.println("Optional Value: " + optionalValue.isPresent()); // Output: true
        System.out.println("Empty Value: " + emptyValue.isPresent()); // Output: false

        // Getting the value or providing a default
        String message = nullableValue.orElse("Default Value");
        System.out.println("Message: " + message); // Output: Default Value
    }
}
```

### 3. New Date and Time API

Java 8 introduced a new Date and Time API in the `java.time` package, which provides a comprehensive set of classes for handling dates, times, durations, and periods. This API addresses many shortcomings of the old `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` classes.

#### Key Classes in the New Date and Time API

- **LocalDate**: Represents a date without time (e.g., 2024-09-17).
- **LocalTime**: Represents a time without date (e.g., 14:30).
- **LocalDateTime**: Represents both date and time (e.g., 2024-09-17T14:30).
- **ZonedDateTime**: Represents date and time with timezone information.
- **Duration**: Represents a time-based amount of time (e.g., hours, minutes).
- **Period**: Represents a date-based amount of time (e.g., days, months).

#### Example of Using LocalDate and LocalDateTime

```java
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

public class DateTimeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
        LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();

        System.out.println("Today's Date: " + today); // Output: Today's Date: 2024-09-17
        System.out.println("Current Date and Time: " + now); // Output: Current Date and Time: 2024-09-17T14:30
    }
}
```

### 4. Stream API (Recap)

The Stream API allows for functional-style operations on sequences of elements. It enables developers to process collections of objects in a declarative way, making code easier to read and maintain.

#### Example of Using Streams

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class StreamRecapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David");

        // Using Stream API to filter names starting with 'A' and print them
        names.stream()
             .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A"))
             .forEach(System.out::println); // Output: Alice
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

In this section, we explored several key features introduced in Java 8, including default methods in interfaces, the `Optional` class for handling null values, the new Date and Time API for improved date/time manipulation, and a recap of the Stream API for functional-style operations on collections. These features significantly enhance Java's capabilities, making it easier for developers to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. In the next section, we will delve into Java 9 features that further improve the language's functionality.

## 18. Java 9 Features

Java 9 introduced several new features and enhancements that improve the overall performance, usability, and modularity of the Java platform. This section will cover some of the most notable features introduced in Java 9, including the Jigsaw Module System, JShell, private methods in interfaces, and improvements to the Stream API.

### 1. Jigsaw Module System

One of the most significant features introduced in Java 9 is the Jigsaw Module System, which allows developers to modularize their applications. This system enables better organization of code, improved encapsulation, and easier management of dependencies.

#### Key Concepts of the Module System

- **Module**: A module is a collection of packages and resources that can be compiled and run together. It is defined in a `module-info.java` file.
- **Module Declaration**: A module is declared using the `module` keyword followed by the module name.

**Example of a Module Declaration**:
```java
// File: module-info.java
module com.example.myapp {
    requires java.base; // Declaring dependencies
    exports com.example.myapp.services; // Exporting packages
}
```

#### Benefits of the Module System

- **Encapsulation**: Modules can restrict access to their internal packages, promoting better encapsulation.
- **Dependency Management**: Modules explicitly declare their dependencies, making it easier to manage them.
- **Performance**: The module system can improve startup time and reduce memory footprint by allowing only required modules to be loaded.

### 2. JShell

JShell is an interactive command-line tool introduced in Java 9 that allows developers to execute Java code snippets quickly without needing to create a full Java application. It is especially useful for testing code, exploring APIs, and learning Java.

#### Example of Using JShell

To start JShell, simply run the `jshell` command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
jshell
```

You can then enter Java expressions and statements directly:

```java
jshell> int sum = 5 + 10;
jshell> System.out.println(sum);
15
```

JShell supports features like auto-completion, documentation lookup, and variable inspection, making it a powerful tool for developers.

### 3. Private Methods in Interfaces

Java 9 allows interfaces to have private methods. These private methods can be used to share code between default methods within the same interface without exposing them to implementing classes.

#### Example of Private Methods in Interfaces

```java
interface MyInterface {
    default void defaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("Default method");
        privateMethod(); // Calling private method
    }

    private void privateMethod() {
        System.out.println("Private method");
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate private methods in interfaces
public class PrivateMethodExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyInterface myInterface = new MyInterface() {};
        myInterface.defaultMethod(); // Output: Default method \n Private method
    }
}
```

### 4. Improvements to the Stream API

Java 9 introduced several enhancements to the Stream API that make it more powerful and easier to use. Some notable improvements include:

- **TakeWhile()**: A new method that allows you to take elements from a stream while a given predicate is true.
- **DropWhile()**: A new method that skips elements until a given predicate returns false.
- **OfNullable()**: A static factory method that creates a stream from a single value or an empty stream if the value is null.

#### Example of Using TakeWhile() and DropWhile()

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class StreamImprovementsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);

        // Using takeWhile()
        numbers.stream()
               .takeWhile(n -> n < 4)
               .forEach(System.out::println); // Output: 1, 2, 3

        // Using dropWhile()
        numbers.stream()
               .dropWhile(n -> n < 4)
               .forEach(System.out::println); // Output: 4, 5, 6
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

In this section, we explored several key features introduced in Java 9, including the Jigsaw Module System for better modularization of applications, JShell for interactive coding and testing, private methods in interfaces for improved code organization within interfaces, and enhancements to the Stream API for more powerful data processing capabilities. These features enhance Java's usability and performance while promoting cleaner code practices. In the next section, we will delve into Java 10 features that further improve language functionality and developer experience.

## 19. Java 10 Features

Java 10 introduced several new features and enhancements aimed at improving the performance, productivity, and usability of the Java programming language. This section will cover some of the most notable features introduced in Java 10, including local variable type inference, improvements to the `Garbage Collector`, and enhancements to the `Collections` API.

### 1. Local Variable Type Inference

One of the most significant features introduced in Java 10 is local variable type inference, which allows developers to declare local variables without explicitly specifying their types. This is done using the `var` keyword, which lets the compiler infer the type based on the assigned value.

#### Example of Local Variable Type Inference

```java
public class LocalVariableInferenceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var message = "Hello, World!"; // Compiler infers String type
        var number = 42;                // Compiler infers int type
        var list = new ArrayList<String>(); // Compiler infers ArrayList<String> type

        System.out.println(message);
        System.out.println(number);
    }
}
```

**Benefits of Local Variable Type Inference**:
- **Conciseness**: Reduces boilerplate code by eliminating repetitive type declarations.
- **Readability**: Makes code easier to read and understand in certain contexts.

### 2. Improvements to the Garbage Collector

Java 10 introduced a new garbage collector called the **Garbage-First (G1) Garbage Collector**, which aims to improve application performance by optimizing memory management. The G1 collector is designed for applications that require low pause times and can handle large heaps efficiently.

#### Key Features of G1 Garbage Collector

- **Concurrent Marking**: G1 performs concurrent marking of live objects, allowing it to reclaim memory more efficiently.
- **Region-Based Memory Management**: The heap is divided into regions, allowing G1 to prioritize garbage collection based on the application's memory usage patterns.
- **Predictable Pause Times**: G1 aims to provide more predictable pause times compared to previous collectors.

### 3. New `Collectors` Methods

Java 10 added new methods to the `Collectors` utility class that enhance the functionality of streams when collecting results.

#### New Collectors Methods

- **toUnmodifiableList()**: Collects elements into an unmodifiable list.
- **toUnmodifiableSet()**: Collects elements into an unmodifiable set.
- **toUnmodifiableMap()**: Collects elements into an unmodifiable map.

#### Example of Using Unmodifiable Collectors

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class UnmodifiableCollectorsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Stream.of("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")
                                    .collect(Collectors.toUnmodifiableList());

        // Attempting to modify the list will throw UnsupportedOperationException
        // names.add("David"); // Uncommenting this line will throw an exception

        System.out.println("Names: " + names);
    }
}
```

### 4. Application Class-Data Sharing (AppCDS)

Java 10 introduced Application Class-Data Sharing (AppCDS), which allows developers to share class metadata across multiple Java Virtual Machine (JVM) instances. This feature improves startup time and reduces memory footprint by allowing common classes to be loaded once and shared among different applications.

#### Key Benefits of AppCDS

- **Reduced Startup Time**: By sharing class metadata, applications can start faster as they do not need to load classes from scratch.
- **Lower Memory Usage**: Common classes are loaded once and shared across JVM instances, reducing overall memory consumption.

### Conclusion

In this section, we explored several key features introduced in Java 10, including local variable type inference with the `var` keyword for improved code conciseness, enhancements to the garbage collector for better memory management, new methods in the `Collectors` utility class for creating unmodifiable collections, and Application Class-Data Sharing (AppCDS) for optimized startup times and reduced memory usage. These features enhance Java's capabilities and improve developer productivity. In the next section, we will delve into Java 11 features that further enhance language functionality and developer experience.

## 20. Java 11 Features

public class HttpClientExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                .uri(URI.create("https://api.github.com"))
                .build();

        client.sendAsync(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString())
              .thenApply(HttpResponse::body)
              .thenAccept(System.out::println)
              .join(); // Wait for completion
    }
}
```

### 2. Local Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters

Java 11 allows the use of `var` in lambda expressions for parameter types. This feature improves readability by reducing boilerplate code when declaring lambda parameters.

#### Example of Local Variable Syntax in Lambda

```java

import java.util.List;

public class LambdaVarExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");

        // Using var for lambda parameters
        names.forEach((var name) -> System.out.println(name));
    }
}
```

### 3. String Methods Enhancements

Java 11 introduced several new methods to the `String` class that enhance its functionality:

- **isBlank()**: Returns true if the string is empty or contains only white space.
- **lines()**: Returns a stream of lines extracted from the string.
- **strip()**: Removes leading and trailing white space.
- **repeat(int count)**: Returns a string whose value is the concatenation of this string repeated count times.

#### Example of New String Methods

```java
public class StringMethodsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "   Hello, World!   ";

        System.out.println("Is blank: " + text.isBlank()); // Output: false
        System.out.println("Stripped: '" + text.strip() + "'"); // Output: 'Hello, World!'
        
        String repeated = "abc".repeat(3);
        System.out.println("Repeated: " + repeated); // Output: abcabcabc
        
        text.lines().forEach(System.out::println); // Prints each line (in this case just one)
    }
}
```

### 4. New File Methods

Java 11 added several utility methods to the `Files` class for easier file operations:

- **Files.readString(Path path)**: Reads all content from a file as a string.
- **Files.writeString(Path path, CharSequence content)**: Writes a string to a file.

#### Example of Using New File Methods

```java
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class FileMethodsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Path path = Paths.get("example.txt");

        // Write string to file
        Files.writeString(path, "Hello, Java 11!");

        // Read string from file
        String content = Files.readString(path);
        System.out.println("File Content: " + content); // Output: Hello, Java 11!
    }
}
```

### 5. Optional Enhancements

Java 11 introduced new methods to the `Optional` class:

- **Optional.isEmpty()**: Returns true if no value is present.

#### Example of Using Optional Enhancements

#### Key Features of Switch Expressions

- **Return Values**: You can use `switch` expressions to assign values directly.
- **Yield Statement**: The `yield` keyword is used to return a value from a switch expression.

#### Example of Switch Expressions

```java
public class SwitchExpressionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String day = "MONDAY";
        
        // Using switch expression
        String typeOfDay = switch (day) {
            case "MONDAY", "FRIDAY", "SUNDAY" -> "Holiday";
            case "TUESDAY", "WEDNESDAY", "THURSDAY" -> "Working Day";
            default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid day: " + day);
        };

        System.out.println("Type of Day: " + typeOfDay); // Output: Type of Day: Holiday
    }
}
```

### 2. JEP 189: Shenandoah Garbage Collector

Java 12 introduced Shenandoah, a low-pause-time garbage collector that aims to reduce GC pause times by performing garbage collection concurrently with the application threads. This is particularly beneficial for applications requiring low latency.

#### Key Features of Shenandoah

- **Concurrent Marking**: Shenandoah performs marking concurrently with application execution.
- **Region-based Heap Management**: It divides the heap into regions, allowing for more efficient memory management.
- **Shorter Pause Times**: By performing garbage collection concurrently, it reduces the time spent in stop-the-world pauses.

### 3. Improvements to the String Class

Java 12 introduced several enhancements to the `String` class that improve performance and usability:

- **String::stripIndent()**: Removes leading whitespace from each line in a string while preserving the overall structure.
- **String::transform()**: Allows you to apply a function to a string and return a new string based on the transformation.

#### Example of Using New String Methods

```java
public class StringImprovementsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String indentedText = """
                Hello,
                  World!
                """;

        // Using stripIndent() to remove leading whitespace
        String strippedText = indentedText.stripIndent();
        System.out.println("Stripped Text:\n" + strippedText);
        
        // Using transform() to convert string to uppercase
        String transformedText = strippedText.transform(String::toUpperCase);
        System.out.println("Transformed Text:\n" + transformedText);
    }
}
```

### 4. New `JEP 230: Microbenchmark Suite`

                          "age": 30,
                          "city": "New York"
                      }
                      """;

        System.out.println("JSON String:\n" + json);
    }
}
```

### 2. Dynamic CDS Archives

Java 13 introduced **dynamic class-data sharing (CDS)** archives, which allow applications to dynamically create a shared archive at runtime. This feature improves application startup time by sharing common class metadata across multiple Java Virtual Machine (JVM) instances.

#### Key Benefits of Dynamic CDS

- **Reduced Startup Time**: By sharing class metadata, applications can start faster as they do not need to load classes from scratch.
- **Memory Savings**: Common classes are loaded once and shared across JVM instances, reducing overall memory consumption.

### 3. Improvements to the Switch Statement

Java 13 continued to enhance the switch statement with further improvements that were initially introduced in Java 12. These improvements focus on making the switch statement more concise and expressive.

#### Example of Enhanced Switch Statement

```java
public class EnhancedSwitchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String day = "TUESDAY";

        // Using switch expression with multiple case labels
        String typeOfDay = switch (day) {
            case "MONDAY", "FRIDAY", "SUNDAY" -> "Holiday";
            case "TUESDAY", "WEDNESDAY", "THURSDAY" -> "Working Day";
            default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid day: " + day);
        };

        System.out.println("Type of Day: " + typeOfDay); // Output: Type of Day: Working Day
    }
}
```

### 4. New `JEP 355: Text Blocks (Standard Feature)`

Java 13 made text blocks a standard feature after their introduction as a preview feature in Java 12. This means that developers can now use text blocks without any experimental flags or limitations.

These features enhance Java's capabilities and improve developer productivity and code readability. In the next section, we will delve into Java 14 features that further improve language functionality and developer experience.

## 23. Java 14 Features

Java 14, released in March 2020, introduced several new features and enhancements aimed at improving the performance, usability, and overall developer experience. This section will cover some of the most notable features introduced in Java 14, including the introduction of helpful NullPointerExceptions, records (preview feature), pattern matching for `instanceof` (preview feature), and more.

### 1. Helpful NullPointerExceptions

One of the most significant features introduced in Java 14 is the enhancement of `NullPointerException` messages. This feature provides more informative messages when a `NullPointerException` occurs, helping developers identify which variable was null.

#### Key Benefits

- **Improved Debugging**: The enhanced messages provide context about which variable was null, making it easier to debug issues.
- **More Informative Stack Traces**: The messages include information about the chain of method calls leading to the exception.

#### Example

```java
public class HelpfulNPEExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = null;
        try {
            System.out.println(str.length()); // This will throw NullPointerException
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage()); // Enhanced message will indicate which variable is null
        }
    }
}
```

To enable this feature, you can use the following JVM option:

```bash
-XX:+ShowMessageBoxOnError
```

### 2. Records (Preview Feature)

Records are a new feature introduced as a preview in Java 14 that provides a compact syntax for declaring classes that are primarily used to hold data. A record automatically generates boilerplate code such as constructors, accessors, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods.

#### Key Benefits of Records

- **Conciseness**: Records reduce boilerplate code when creating data-carrying classes.
- **Immutability**: Records are immutable by default, promoting safer code practices.

#### Example of Using Records

```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {
    // Additional methods can be added if needed
}

public class RecordExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("Alice", 30);
        System.out.println(person.name()); // Output: Alice
        System.out.println(person.age()); // Output: 30
        System.out.println(person); // Output: Person[name=Alice, age=30]
    }
}
```

### 3. Pattern Matching for `instanceof` (Preview Feature)

Java 14 introduced pattern matching for `instanceof` as a preview feature. This allows developers to simplify type checks and casts in a single operation. Instead of writing separate lines to check the type and cast it, you can do both in one line.

#### Key Benefits

- **Cleaner Code**: Reduces boilerplate code when checking types and casting.
- **Increased Readability**: Makes code easier to read and understand.

#### Example of Pattern Matching for `instanceof`

```java
public class PatternMatchingExample {
    public static void printLength(Object obj) {
        if (obj instanceof String s) { // Type check and cast in one line
            System.out.println("Length: " + s.length());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Not a string.");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printLength("Hello"); // Output: Length: 5
        printLength(42);      // Output: Not a string.
    }
}
```

### 4. New `JEP 305: Pattern Matching for `instanceof` (Standard Feature)

Java 14 made pattern matching for `instanceof` a standard feature after being introduced as a preview in previous versions. This means developers can now use this feature without any experimental flags or limitations.

                          "city": "New York"
                      }
                      """;

        System.out.println("JSON String:\n" + json);
    }
}
```

### 2. Sealed Classes (Preview Feature)

Sealed classes are a new feature introduced as a preview in Java 15 that allows developers to control which classes can extend or implement them. This feature provides more control over inheritance hierarchies and helps to maintain a well-defined API.

#### Key Benefits of Sealed Classes

- **Controlled Inheritance**: Sealed classes allow you to specify which classes can extend them, enhancing encapsulation.
- **Better API Design**: Helps create more predictable and maintainable APIs.

#### Example of Using Sealed Classes

```java
public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Rectangle {
}

final class Circle extends Shape {
    // Circle implementation
}

final class Rectangle extends Shape {
    // Rectangle implementation
}

public class SealedClassExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape shape = new Circle(); // Valid
        // Shape shape2 = new Shape(); // Invalid: Cannot instantiate sealed class
    }
}
```

### 3. Hidden Classes

Java 15 introduced hidden classes, which are classes that cannot be used directly by the bytecode of other classes. Hidden classes are intended for use by frameworks that generate classes at runtime and want to ensure that these classes are not accessible from other parts of the application.

#### Key Benefits of Hidden Classes

- **Encapsulation**: Hidden classes help encapsulate implementation details and prevent accidental usage.
- **Dynamic Class Generation**: Useful for frameworks that generate classes dynamically at runtime.

### 4. Improvements to the String Class

Java 15 added several enhancements to the `String` class:

- **String::toFormat()**: A new method that allows formatting strings using a specified format.
- **String::strip()**: Improved methods for stripping leading and trailing whitespace.

#### Example of Using New String Methods

```java
public class StringImprovementsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "   Hello, Java 15!   ";

        // Using strip() to remove leading and trailing whitespace
        String strippedText = text.strip();
        System.out.println("Stripped Text: '" + strippedText + "'"); // Output: 'Hello, Java 15!'

        // Example of formatting (if applicable in context)
        String formatted = String.format("Message: %s", strippedText);
        System.out.println(formatted); // Output: Message: Hello, Java 15!
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

In this section, we explored several key features introduced in Java 15, including text blocks as a standard feature for improved multi-line string handling, sealed classes for controlled inheritance, hidden classes for better encapsulation in dynamic class generation, and enhancements to the `String` class.

Records, which were introduced as a preview feature in Java 14, became a standard feature in Java 16. Records provide a compact syntax for declaring classes that are primarily used to hold data, automatically generating boilerplate code such as constructors, accessors, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods.

#### Example of Using Records

```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {
    // Additional methods can be added if needed
}

public class RecordExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("Alice", 30);
        System.out.println(person.name()); // Output: Alice
        System.out.println(person.age()); // Output: 30
        System.out.println(person); // Output: Person[name=Alice, age=30]
    }
}
```

### 3. Improvements to the Stream API

Java 16 introduced several enhancements to the `Stream` API:

- **Stream::toList()**: A new terminal operation that collects stream elements into an unmodifiable list.
- **Stream::mapMulti()**: A new intermediate operation that maps each input element to zero or more output elements.

#### Example of Using New Stream Methods

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class StreamImprovementsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Stream.of("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")
                                   .toList(); // Collect to unmodifiable list

        System.out.println("Names: " + names);

        Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
              .mapMulti((i, downstream) -> {
                  downstream.accept(i);
                  downstream.accept(i * 10);
              })
              .forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```
